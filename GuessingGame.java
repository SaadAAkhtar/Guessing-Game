	  automatically incrementing x. This results in x staying in the same spot and not skipping the next number. Anyways, each number in the ArrayList that the outer for loop
	  goes through is converted into a string in order to allow character-by-character comparison. This is done by 2 different loops are entered depending on how many matches
	  there are. However, they are similar in that they basically remove any numbers from the ArrayList that cannot possibly be the correct guess.
