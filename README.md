# Guessing-Game

Hi there! This is my very first repository here on GitHub that I created to see how GitHub works. This repository contains a ReadMe and a Java program called GuessingGame. GuessingGame is a program I completed as an assignment and I wrote all the code in it aside from the main method that was initially provided by my professor. Feel free to try it out!
