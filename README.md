# Guessing-Game

Hi there! This is my very first repository here on GitHub that I created to see how GitHub works. This repository contains a ReadMe and a Java program called GuessingGame. GuessingGame is a program I completed as an assignment and I wrote all the code in it aside from the main method that was initially provided by my professor. In the game, you are asked to come up with a number between 1000 and 9999 and it's the program's job to figure out what number you came up with by continually asking you how many digits it got correct with each guess it makes. Feel free to try it out!
